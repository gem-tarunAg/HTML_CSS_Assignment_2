            <h1 class="heading">Chaining</h1>
            <p class="content">Chaining is used for reducing CSS code by applying some common properties on parents and differing them in children enables us to write reduntant code for differnt elements</p>

            <p> Here you can see we have only changed the font style of both cotent just by chaining the css using combinators.<p>
            <div  class="boxes">
                <p id="p1">Example 1</p>
            </div>
            <div  class="boxes">
                <p id="p2">Example 2</p>
            </div>
            <p>Here also you can see we have same design for both boxes and just differed the background color of the text by the use of chaining no need to design these two boxes seperately. </p>
