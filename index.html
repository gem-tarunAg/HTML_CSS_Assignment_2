        <div class="rem">
            heading:body :: 2rem : 1rem
            <h2 id="rem_heading">rem</h2>
            <p id="rem_content">rem units are relational to the font-size value of the HTML tag. For example, if the font size of the HTML tag is 16px (that is the default size for an html document), then 1rem unit is equal to 16px. That makes .5rem=8px, 2rem=32px, etc.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="em">
            heading:body :: 2em : 1em
            <h2 id="em_heading">em</h2>
            <p id="em_content">
                em units are similar to rem units, but whereas a rem unit always references the HTML tag, an em unit is relational only to it's nearest defined parent element. For example, if the div wrapper for a callout is set to font-size:20px, then any child element set to 1em would be the equivalent of 20px, .5em=10px, 2em=40px, etc.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="vh">
            heading:body :: 4vh : 2vh
            <h2 id="vh_heading">vh</h2>
            <p id="vh_content">
               the vh (view-height) unit is relational to the viewport size, where 100vh  is 100% of the viewport's height. For example, if a viewport is 1600px high, and you specify something as being 2vh, that will be the equivalent of 2% of the viewport height, or 32px.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="vw">
            heading:body :: 2vw : 1vw
            <h2 id="vw_heading">vw</h2>
            <p id="vw_content">  the vw (view-width) unit is relational to the viewport size, where 100vw is 100% of the viewport's width. For example, if a viewport is 1600px wide, and you specify something as being 2vw, that will be the equivalent of 2% of the viewport width, or 32px.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="px">
            heading:body :: 20px : 10px
            <h2 id="px_heading">px</h2>
            <p id="px_content">Pixels are defined as a single point in a graphic image, and are often tied to viewport resolution. If a viewport is 1600x90, that typically means that there are 1600px pixel columns & 900 pixel rows, with a pixel in each cell. This definition is maybe overly simple when factoring in dpi or pixel density, but can stand as reference for the most part.</p>
